# simpleTaskManager

**Hyperion Software Developer Bootcamp**

This is a simple Financial Calculator which I developed. 
Further functionality was added to this project further on in the course and you can see this in the TaskManager repo. 

This part of the project was to focus on working with files and string manipulation, and
also use conditional logic and loops in this task.

**Task:** 
In this task, you will be creating a program for a small business that can
help it to manage tasks assigned to each member of the team. You will
extend this task in the next Capstone project.
