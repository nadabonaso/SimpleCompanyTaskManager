# simpleTaskManager

**Hyperion Software Developer Bootcamp**

This task was to create a program for a small business that can
help it to manage tasks assigned to each member of the team. This part of the project was to focus on working with files and string manipulation, and
also use conditional logic and loops.

Further functionality was added to this project further on in the course and you can see this in the TaskManager repo.
